# co2-monitor
This repository contains the code for a CO2 monitoring device built with an ESP32 microcontroller board, an MH-Z19B CO2 sensor and a small 128 x 64 pixels OLED display with the with the common SSD1306 dirver.

### wiring
In the folder wiring, you find a wiring diagram, detailing how to hook up the microcontroller with the sensor and the display.

### micropython code
The five files in this folder have to be copied to the microcontroller, which has to be set up for running mircopython in advance.

### python code
The file consolaB.py has been generated using the command line tool [font_to_py.py](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py/blob/master/font_to_py.py) by [peterhinch](https://github.com/peterhinch)
```
python3 font_to_py.py -x CONSOLAB.ttf 25 consolaB.py

```
If you want to use a different font than consolaB or a different font size for displaying the sensor readings on the display, run the above command with CONSOLAB.ttf replaced by your own font .ttf file and with 25 replaced by your desired font size. Furthermore, in the file main.py in the mircopyhton code folder, you have to replace the line 
```
import consolaB

```
with whatever name you give the output file generated by the font_to_py tool.
